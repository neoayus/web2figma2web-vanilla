## WHY does this repo exist? 
I been wanting to create a project of my own, for which i had to learn 'how to design?' 
so i stepped in and learn Figma and pftt i din't had a design of my own to implement so i tried my so new learnt figma skills to copy apple dot com's mobile layout, it was fun, idc if y'all clown but thass where i step up 

and since i had the design ready, i was curious how does 'design' --> 'dev' works and i tried writing code for the layout i made, 
and It ain't react cause i ain't confident in that and i had to finish this 'fore my college reopens ( might as well create this with react waha )

been fun learning figma, made it wayy easier for me to understand how web designs and layouts work  
alsooo 'webkit' is a thing, ik i'm late to all this

## What i learned 
- figma made layout
- css positioning and structure clicked more when i saw the visual side first 
- 'flex-box' and 'responsive' designs used to be stress for me 'fore figma

- Figma for design (design istn't mine tho)
- HTML5  
- CSS3
- Vanilla JS (jus a lil)
